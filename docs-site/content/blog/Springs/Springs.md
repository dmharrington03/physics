Spring forces are perhaps the most fun physical interaction to play with in a simulation. Even better, they are very simply described by a short equation:

$$
F = -kx
$$

where $F$ is the spring force, $x$ is the displacement of the length of the spring from its rest length (where it's neither being pulled or compressed), and $k$ is a constant unique to each spring, representing its stiffness.

This should make intuitive sense - the more you compress a spring, the more it seems to 'push back' to expand to its rest length.

This basic relationship combined with some
